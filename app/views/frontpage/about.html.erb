			<h3>Why Ruby?</h3>
				<p class="well well-sm">As an easy to use and widely extendable programming language, Ruby was the perfect choice to bring this game to reality via a web browser. We wanted to remove the need to download, install and maintain the game; and instead let you focus on just playing and enjoying life!</p>
